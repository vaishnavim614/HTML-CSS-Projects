            <p>C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language. C# enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET. C# has its roots in the C family of languages and will be immediately familiar to C, C++, Java, and JavaScript programmers.</p>
            <p>The C# programming language was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) in 2002 and ISO/IEC (ISO/IEC 23270) in 2003. Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler), and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.

              <ul>
                <li>
              It is easy to understand
              <p>
              One of the main reasons why people choose C over other programming languages is its simplicity. C is a highly portable language as programs coded in it are far more fast and efficient.
                </p>
                </li>

                 <li>
              Presence of many Libraries
              <p> 
C Language provides lots of built-in functions which consist of system-generated functions and user-defined functions.</p>
                </li>
                 <li>
              Easy to write
              <p>
Another reason why C is so popular as an efficient language among programmers is that it allows them to create their own software without having to worry about syntax errors. </p>
                </li>
                
                 <li>
              Fast execution speed
              <p>
If you want to execute your application quickly, then C is probably the right choice for you. Since C uses fewer instructions, it executes faster than other programming languages</p>
                </li>

                 <li>
              Execution of algorithms and data structures
              <p> 
The utilization of algorithms and data structures in C has made program calculations extremely quick and smooth.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Programming Style
                  <br>	The C programming language is a procedural language type.  The language is function-driven.<br>	C++ is an object-oriented programming language type. The language is object-driven.
                </li>
      <br>
                <li>
                  Approach
                  <br>C programming follows a top to down programming approach that focuses on the steps rather than the data. 	C++ follows a bottom-to-top approach that focuses on data rather than the overall procedure. 
                </li>
    <br>
                <li>
                  Data Types
                  <br>	C supports built-in data types. C is a basic version of a programming language and supports only primitive, fixed data types.
      <br> 
	Besides built-in data types, C++ also supports user-defined data types. C++ is an enhanced version of C and supports generic data types. 
                </li>
<br>
<li>
            Input/Output functions
                  <br>	
In C, scanf and printf functions are used for input and output operations.
      <br> 
While in C++, cin and cout are used for input and output operations, respectively.
                </li>
